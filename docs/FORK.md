# "Fork"-ing a Repository
On GitHub, you can create your own fork of a public repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right corner of a repository.
A "Fork" is your personal copy of a repository.
This means you will have read/write access to make branches and push code changes freely.

Any changes you make to your fork will only be available on your fork.

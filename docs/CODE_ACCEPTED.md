# Finally, Back to main!
After your code has been approved, your code can be merged into master!
If you are a core contributor, you may be expected to merge your own code.
When you merge code, *especially if you follow a tight ci-cd pipeline*, **you are responsible to see that code deploy**.

More commonly, however, you will not merge your own code into main.
After your code is approved, someone with write access (typically your reviewer) will merge the code into the main branch.
Once you see your code in the main branch, you will appear as a contributor on the repository!

Congratulations! You are now a contributor to open source!!! :)

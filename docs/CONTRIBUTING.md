# Contributing

This repository is designed as a practice repository for code contribution!
You can practice all the major, functional pieces to making an open-source code contribution in a safe, welcoming environment!

## Code of Conduct
As always, code contributions must follow [The Huddle's Code of Conduct](https://codehuddle.org/code-of-conduct).
If you are not yet familiar with it, please review it!

## How to Contribute
In order to "contribute," we would like to see you perform these steps:

### 1. Create an Issue
Raise an issue about your favorite programming language.
Mine is CLISP, so my issue would have the title:
```text
CLISP
```

Fill the description with a short description why it is your favorite language
```text
I like CLISP because of the parenthesis
```

Submit your ticket! A contributor will assign you to the ticket (since you will be the one to implement it), but feel free to start working on your pull request right away! :)


### 2. Hello World!
Follow the ["Making a Pull Request" guide in the README](../README.md) to make a `Hello World!` program in the language you mentioned above!
Make the pull request, and tag a maintainer for review!

When you make the pull request, include words `closes #X` where `X` is the number of your issue!
This will automagically close the issue after your pull request is accepted.


### 3. Changes
The code reviewer will request changes.
They will probably be arbitrary.
This is just so you get used to seeing your code come back.
Remember: this is *normal*!!!


### 4. All better!
Correct the requested changes, and re-request review!
Your pull request will be merged in.
If you successfully included the `closes #X`, your ticket will close automatically!
If not, you will have to close the ticket yourself.
